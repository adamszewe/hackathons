* Facile.it
* Team: 6 people
* I learned how to use the Amazon APIs to gather information about products
* (no code available)
* (any photos available ?)
* That  was my 1st hackathon, so I  didn't really expect anything, even though I staid up all night to keep  coding our solution.
The funniest part was 15 minutes from finishing we had a bug, and it was due to the fact that in PHP you cannot
concatenate strings with a '+' but you do it with a dot .
