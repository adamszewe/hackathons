Each  description follows this format:

# 1. Facile.it - Milan, Italy
* Date: 14,15 November 2016
* Facile.it
* Team: 6 people
* I learned how to use the Amazon APIs to gather information about products
* (no code available)
* (any photos available ?)
* That  was my 1st hackathon, so I  didn't really expect anything, even though I staid up all night to keep  coding our solution.


# 2. Accenture Digital Hackathon, Milan, Italy
